When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    In the case when I want to make some changes to my project from another computer or some other person is contributing in my project then one might want to use a remote repository having access from anywhere over the internet.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Pulling changes manually lets me explicitly choose whether I want the changes made in the online repo to be in my local system or not. Also it saves me from accidentally deleting unsaved changes made in the local repo.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork: Let's you use repositories of other people on GitHub and make changes for your own use.
    Branch: It is used when one wants to add some functionality to the current project but is not sure if it will work or not.
    Clone: It is making a clone of one's repo from some source like GitHub or even local computer.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
